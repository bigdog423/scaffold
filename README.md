Scaffold is an integrated development environment for creating
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) [translators](https://github.com/zotero/translators/).


## Installation

To install the extension:
* Download the `xpi` file of the [latest release](https://github.com/zotero/scaffold/releases)
* In Zotero, click `Tools â†’ Add-Ons`, then drag the `.xpi` for the plugin onto the Add-Ons window that opens.

## Build and release

To build the extension, enter this directory and run build.sh:

    ./build.sh [VERSION]

This will create a scaffold.xpi file, which you can add as an add-on in Zotero. (This is basically just a ZIP of the `src` directory.)

For releasing a new version, use this command:

    ./release VERSION

## Development

Create a text file containing the full path to the `src` directory,
name the file `scaffold@zotero.org`, and place it in the `extensions`
directory of the [Zotero profile directory](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/profile_directory).
Restart Zotero to try the latest code changes.
